Other Components:
- Message Broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for async communication between services
- Redis for Caching
- S3/GCP Storage for media/files
- Centralized Logging (ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)
- Service Discovery (like Consul or built-in with Kubernetes)

Infra:
- Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) for service orchestration
- Istio (for service mesh, traffic management, security)
- Secrets Manager (for sensitive config)
ðŸ”µ Important Notes:

Each service has its own database ("Database per Service" pattern â€” crucial in microservices).

Services communicate synchronously (via REST/gRPC) or asynchronously (via messaging queues).

API Gateway routes requests, handles authentication, throttling, etc.

Authentication is usually JWT-based across services.

Monitoring and Logging are essential for real production systems.

Resilience patterns like Circuit Breaker (Hystrix or built-in) are important.

Would you like me to show you a more polished architecture diagram image (like how you'd put in a PPT or a project doc)?
I can draw a beautiful one too if you want! ðŸš€
Should I? ðŸŽ¯
